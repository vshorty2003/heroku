# heroku

set up a database on Heroku for the Noteful application and redeploy the full stack application.

Configure the server for deployment. Add a database on Heroku and setup the migration scripts to create the remote database on deploy. Perform the deploy and note the URL of the deployed application. Use Postman to verify that the server is properly deployed and works as expected.
Update the React client with the URL of the server. Run the client locally to ensure that it can fetch the data from the remote server correctly. Deploy the React client to Zeit. If you get CORS errors after the deploy, modify the CORS settings on the server and redeploy the server.
